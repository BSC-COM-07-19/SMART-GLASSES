*VISION X SMART GLASSES - Smart Glasses Navigation System*

Welcome to the Vision-X Github repository! Vision-X is an advanced navigation system designed for visually impaired individuals, utilizing smart glasses and AI-powered conversational tools to enhance mobility and independence. This repository contains the source code, development history, and supporting materials for the Vision-X platform.

STRUCTURE

This repository is structured as follows:

backend/: Contains the backend code for the Vision-X platform, including API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework. It also handles communication between the smart glasses and the server.

frontend/: Features the frontend code for the Vision-X platform, implemented using JavaScript, React, and Redux. This directory includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface and controls the interaction with the smart glasses.

models/: Includes the trained AI models used by Vision-X to process real-time image data and provide navigation assistance. Models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries and support functionalities such as obstacle/object detection and route planning.

Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and improvement of the Vision-X smart glasses navigation system. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

How Vision-X Leverages AI
